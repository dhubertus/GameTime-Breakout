## GameTime-Breakout
## Project Status
Breakout’s functionality is complete, however I would like to revisit this project to adjust our hit detection between blocks and ball as the collisions can act funny sometimes. I would also like to increase game usability on mobile as to easily play with your thumb.

Our version of Breakout was designed to look like and sound like the original atari version from the 70’s. Unfortunately the sound had to be removed for hosting reasons.

## Reflection
The goal when building Breakout was to build a game that is playable in the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Additionally we were to use design patterns to drive implementation of code, separate business-logic code from view-related code, and to use TDD while building out the application. The game of choice was to be full-featured and playable with sufficient UX allowing to user to fully interact with the game.
 
The most difficult part of developing Breakout was learning to use Canvas and mapping out how to organize code/divvy up responsibility. Writing tests for Breakout was also a challenge, but forced you to have a firm grasp of exactly what you were trying to test and how you app works to produce the matching environment to that you are trying to test.
